# From Zero to C++

This repository documents my learning journey in C++, ranging from my earliest exercises and syntax tests to progressively more structured implementations.  

The main goal is to consolidate the fundamentals of the language and software development in general, covering topics such as control structures, functions, pointers, object-oriented programming, templates, and file manipulation.  

Each directory or file represents a specific stage of this study process, serving both as a record of my progression and as a reference for other beginners who wish to follow a practical C++ learning path.
